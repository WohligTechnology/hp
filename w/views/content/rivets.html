Hindustan Platinum is Indiaâ€™s first company to introduce the bimetal contacts in 1973. This revolutionary product, that reduces Silver content substantially, helps in lowering cost while retaining high quality.</p><p>In bimetal contact rivet, a Silver layer is metallurgically bonded to Copper base. This high strength bonding imparts better thermal & current transfer & allows customers to experience the performance of solid Silver at a price that is economically viable.</p><p>Solid & bimetal rivets are usually supplied with a solid shank, but are also available with indent or chamfered shank. Accompanying heads can be flat, radial, line or conical. These rivets are used in wiring accessories, relays, contactors etc. We are one of the few manufacturers in the world who have technology to manufacture Silver Tin Oxide & Silver Cadmium Oxide by internal oxidation (melting) as well as Powder Metallurgy (sintered).</p></div></div></div><div class=row><div class=col-md-12><div class=text-center><div class=hp-tab-btn><div class=btn-group><button type=button name=button ng-click="tabchanges('az',1)" class="{{classp}} btn-blue font-bold text-up">TYPICAL SHAPES OF RIVETS</button> <button type=button name=button ng-click="tabchanges('bz',2)" class="{{classv}} btn-blue font-bold text-up">DIMENSIONAL RANGES & TOLERANCES</button></div></div></div></div></div><div class=az ng-if="tabs=='az'"><div class=row><div class=col-md-6 ng-repeat="item in shape track by $index"><div class=hp-shape><img ng-src={{item}} alt="Hindustan Platinum" class=img-responsive></div></div></div></div><div class=az ng-if="tabs=='bz'"><div class=row><div class=col-md-12><div class=hp-dimesion-tbl><table class=table><thead><tr><th>Dimension</th><th>Dimensional Range</th><th>Tolerance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Head Diameter (HD)</td><td>1.2mm to 12mm</td><td>+/- 0.5mm</td></tr><tr><td>Head hickness (HT)</td><td>0.2mm to 3.5mm</td><td>+/- 0.5mm</td></tr><tr><td>Shank Diameter (SD)</td><td>0.58mm to 5mm</td><td>- 0.5mm</td></tr><tr><td>Shank Length (SD)</td><td>0.4mm to 15mm</td><td>+/- 0.1mm</td></tr><tr><td>Silver Alloy Layer (t)</td><td>As per customer's Requirement'</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class=pb60><div class=container><div class=row><div class=hp-pl><h2 class="text-up font-bold color-primary">alloys</h2></div><div class=col-md-12><div class=hp-acc><uib-accordion close-others=oneAtATime><div uib-accordion-group="" class=panel-default is-open=status.open><uib-accordion-heading>Pure Silver (Pure Ag)</uib-accordion-heading><div class=hp-dt-in><p>Endowed with highest electrical and thermal conductivity, it has excellent formability.

Contacts are manufactured with or without additives. Special additives keep the contact resistance stable throughout. The standard grades of contact material available are AgSno2 14 %, AgSnO2 12 % and AgSno2 10 %. It is one of the most environment friendly contact material as it does not contain any hazardous substance.</p><p>Contacts are available with a backing layer of Silver and optionally, with an additional layer of brazing alloy.

Its salient feature includes low mechanical wear due to higher hardness, low contact resistance almost constant throughout the life of contact, low material transfer, low burning, good arc migration and better arc extinguishing properties. It also has better anti welding property. It has good formability with Nickel upto 20 %. If this percent goes higher, formability reduces a bit, but wear resistance increases.
