When passing through the catalyst gauze pack, the ammonia content in the process gas decreases, while the reaction temperature increases. In addition, other parameters like, the operating pressure, ammonia ratio, feed gas temperature, gauze or the process temperature and the loading of the catalyst vary considerably in the individual processes.</p><p>The structure of the catalyst gauze and its wire gauge determines the ammonia conversion, the gauze performance in terms of desired product selectivity, catalyst aging and the primary burn-off loss of noble metals.</p><p>Our knitting technology allows us to optimize the designing of the catalyst system for every unique process plant conditions of our customers.</p><p>Three-dimensional catalyst gauzes have the advantage of an alternating spatial arrangement of the wires and thus are characterized in a more homogeneous ammonia conversion behavior as well as higher temperature resistance.</p><div class="row mt20"><div class=col-md-3 ng-repeat="item in data1 track by $index"><a href={{item.img}} rel=gallery1 fancybox-box=""><img ng-src={{item.img}} alt="Hindustan Platinum" class=img-responsive></a></div></div></div></div><div uib-accordion-group="" class=panel-default><uib-accordion-heading>Our Getter System for Platinum & Rhodium Recovery</uib-accordion-heading><div class=hp-pr-decs><p>For decades, not much has changed in the structure and the alloy of getter gauzes. They consist of a close-woven fabric made of 95% palladium and 5% nickel alloy. This is surprising, since the getter gauzes recover a great part of platinum and rhodium losses from the catalyst and thus, have the potential to provide a significant contribution to the economics of the overall process.</p><p>The lack of interest in technological development in the getter system can be traced back to the parallel occurring palladium losses, which reduce the efficiency of the getter system significantly. We have understood the nuances in this technological challenge and have focused our efforts on improving and shaping the future of the getter gauze technology.</p><p>The use of specific wire thickness and the choice of specific weights of the individual layers of the getter system enable us to achieve significantly higher platinum and palladium recovery rates with reduced palladium loadings. We have now channalised our efforts towards the reduction of the palladium losses that critically affect the getter efficiency.</p><div class="row mt20"><div class=col-md-3 ng-repeat="item in data2 track by $index"><a href={{item.img}} rel=gallery1 fancybox-box=""><img ng-src={{item.img}} alt="Hindustan Platinum" class=img-responsive></a></div></div></div></div><div uib-accordion-group="" class=panel-default><uib-accordion-heading>Our Corrugated Getter System</uib-accordion-heading><div class=hp-pr-decs><p>Especially with higher primary burn-off losses, that are mostly associated with the high pressure plants, an important aspect with the application and efficiency of the getter system can be attributed to the close-woven structure that increasingly becomes obstructed through the alloying of platinum and rhodium and their re-crystallization with palladium.</p><p>Flat getter systems in high pressure plants suffer a relatively high pressure drop. For such operating conditions, our corrugated getter gauzes are recommended, which not only help significantly lower the pressure drop due to the specific corrugated (serrated) structure of the getter system, but also provides a much larger surface area for efficient and optimum precious metal recovery.</p><div class="row mt20"><div class=col-md-3 ng-repeat="item in data3 track by $index"><a href={{item.img}} rel=gallery1 fancybox-box=""><img ng-src={{item.img}} alt="Hindustan Platinum" class=img-responsive></a></div></div></div></div><div uib-accordion-group="" class=panel-default><uib-accordion-heading>Cleaning Operation</uib-accordion-heading></div></uib-accordion></div></div></div></div></section><section><div class=hp-get-sec><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-md-12><div class="text-center p20"><h1 class="color-primary font-bold">GET IN TOUCH</h1><div class=hp-gt><div class="if-no-slider hp-list p20"><ul class=padding0><li ng-repeat="s in get track by $index"><div class=hp-cn><h3 class="text-up font-bold margin0">{{s.name}}</h3><p>or info related queries email</p><p>us on <a>{{s.email}}</a></p></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="hp-dn hp-list p20"><ul class=padding0><li ng-repeat="s in download track by $index"><a><div class=hp-dn-icon><img src=img/download.png alt="Hindustan Platinum"></div><div class="hp-dn-txt display-inline"><span class="font-bold text-up color-white">{{s.name}}</span></div></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></section>
