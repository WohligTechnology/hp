Hindustan Platinum is Indiaâ€™s first company to introduce the bimetal contacts in 1973. This revolutionary product, that reduces Silver content substantially, helps in lowering cost while retaining high quality.</p><p>In bimetal contact rivet, a Silver layer is metallurgically bonded to Copper base. This high strength bonding imparts better thermal & current transfer & allows customers to experience the performance of solid Silver at a price that is economically viable.</p><p>Solid & bimetal rivets are usually supplied with a solid shank, but are also available with indent or chamfered shank. Accompanying heads can be flat, radial, line or conical. These rivets are used in wiring accessories, relays, contactors etc. We are one of the few manufacturers in the world who have technology to manufacture Silver Tin Oxide & Silver Cadmium Oxide by internal oxidation (melting) as well as Powder Metallurgy (sintered).</p></div><div><img src=img/hp-main-cat.jpg class=img-responsive></div></div></div></div></section>
