                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
                        content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                        infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                                <p>APetrochemical Industries & Oil Refineries employ different types of precious metal catalysts depending on their application, having supports of soluble or insoluble alumina, silica/alumina, zeolites, carbon, etc. Over
                                    a period of years, no matter which congiguration is used, eventually the catalysts lose their effectiveness, and the remaining precious metals must be recovered.</p>

                                    Hidustan Platinum provides such industries both large and small with integrated services of recovery and refining of precious metals either on toll refining basis or on out-right purchase. Located n Navi Mumbai, India, Hindustan Platinum refines platinum,
                                    palladium, rhodium, irridium, gold, silver as well as rhenium from many diverse industrial sources, typically from Petrochemicals & Oil refineries. A few of the catalysts refined are paraxylene catalyst, Reforming catalyst,
                                    Isomerisation catalyst, PTA catalyst, VAM catalyst, Ethylene oxide catalyst, etc.
