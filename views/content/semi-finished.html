                                        Silver Tin Oxide by both internal oxidation (melting) & by powder metallurgy (sintered).
                                        Contacts are manufactured with or without additives. Special additives keep the contact
                                        resistance stable throughout. The standard grades of contact material available are
                                        AgSno2 14 %, AgSnO2 12 % and AgSno2 10 %. It is one of the most environment friendly
